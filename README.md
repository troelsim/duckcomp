A simple compressor VST using [overdrivenpotato's vst2 library](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-vst2)

This compressor has a fixed gain reduction (the `Range` parameter) instead of a traditional ratio control. When the sidechain signal is over the threshold, the signal is reduced by the given value, and the `Ratio` knob controls the sharpness of the sigmoid used to determine this.

Sort of like an inverse gate.

It gives an aggressive but consistent sound for ducking signals, sidechain pumping etc.

The topology is feed-forward, and the detector is RMS.
